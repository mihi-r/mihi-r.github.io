                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>My name is Mihir Patel and I am a third-year student at the <a class="regular-link" href="https://uc.edu" target="_blank">University of Cincinnati</a> pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I aim to enhance my personal skills by getting involved in different environments whether that be joining an organization, gaining work experience, or working on a personal project in my free time.</p>
                <p>During my co-op experience at <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/" target="_blank">Siemens PLM Software</a>, I was able to get my hands on working with various tools such as Amazon Web Services and Docker. I was able to learn what it takes to put a machine learning architecture to production. As the Director of Technology for CEAS Tribunal, I'm able to apply my skills in web development to create a sign-in application used at the official university career fair. There, I also get a lead a committee to embark on a website redesign initiative for the organization. I get to bring my vision to life while talking about the things I love. With my experience working as a Peer Leader, it allowed me to broaden my potential by exposing me to new skills such as public speaking, building interactive presentations, and daily life management.</p>
                <p>For fun, a favorite hobby of mine to create stop-motion animations. It is the art of taking multiple pictures and fusing them all in succession to create one fluid animation. Similar to software design, patience and persistence are required to create a successful product, however, the end goal is always worth it.</p>   
                <p>To connect with me, you can contact me at <a class="regular-link" href="mailto:patel3mh@mail.uc.edu">patel3mh@mail.uc.edu.</a></p>

                <p>This project was developed to showcase events and other information regarding the Engineering Tribunal. I learned how to use a CMS, specifically Drupal 8, to create a website a normal user can use to manage the website.</p>
