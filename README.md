## Getting Started
### Initial Set Up
Prerequisites:
- nodeJS for NPM

1. `cd` into your desired working directory.
2. `git clone https://github.com/mihi-r/mihi-r.github.io.git` to clone the repo (alternatively, you can use the SSH clone if you have that set up).
3. `cd` into mihi-r.github.io.
4. Run npm install to install all of the needed modules for the project.
5. Next, run either `gulp dev` or `gulp watch`. `gulp watch` will compile the javascript file and CSS into a minified cross-browser compatible code while `gulp dev` will not minify files. It is recommended to use `gulp dev` for development to make debugging easier and reserve `gulp watch` for the final production code.

### Making changes
1. Make sure either `gulp dev` or `gulp watch` is running.
2. Make your desired change.
3. Visit the webpage and clear browser cache.
